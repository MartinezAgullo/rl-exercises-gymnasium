# RL Exercises with Gymnasium

A collection of Reinforcement Learning exercises based on a Udemy course, updated and adapted to use the modern Gymnasium API.
Includes practical implementations of classic control environments and examples for experimenting with RL algorithms.

## Exercises

### rl01_cartpole_random.py
[CartPole](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/) environment with random actions to test the Gymnasium API.

### rl02_frozen_lake_random.py
[FrozenLake](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/) environment with random actions.

### rl03_cartpole_videos.py
The same [CartPole](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/) as in [rl01_cartpole_random.py](https://github.com/MartinezAgullo/rl-exercises-gymnasium/blob/main/rl01_cartpole_random.py), but with video recording.

### rl04_frozen_lake_stochastic_deterministic.py
Includes configuration to switch between stochastic and deterministic versions of the environment.
